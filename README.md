# Shift Insight Dashboard

**Shift Insight** is a full-stack analytics dashboard for monitoring warehouse and logistics operations.  
It visualizes real-time performance metrics such as **active shifts, stations, and event throughput**, powered by **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Project Status: Actively Being Improved

This project is functional but under ongoing development.  
Planned improvements include:
- Real warehouse data integration via Prisma + Supabase
- Authentication and user roles
- Performance insights dashboard with filtering
